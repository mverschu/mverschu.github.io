Welcome to our latest Proving Grounds lab walkthrough! In this post, we’ll explore how to identify and exploit vulnerabilities within an application running on a Windows-like server. This lab is a great example of how thorough enumeration can lead to success, particularly when dealing with services that seem out of place. It’s considered beginner-friendly as it mainly involves leveraging known exploits and adapting them to the target environment.

## Discovery

The first step in any engagement is service enumeration, so we initiate a full port scan to identify all the services running on the target machine. Immediately, the scan results reveal a familiar Windows environment due to the presence of SMB, MSRPC, and NetBIOS services.

However, something unexpected stands out: SSH and a web server running on port 8080. Finding SSH on a Windows machine is rare and raises suspicion. This anomaly suggests there might be custom configurations or additional applications in place, requiring further investigation.

```bash
nmap -p- -Pn -n -vv -T4 192.168.171.179
```

Curious about the web server, we navigate to port 8080 and discover it’s running Argus Surveillance System, an application used for video monitoring. This is a promising lead, as applications like these often have web vulnerabilities.

### Vulnerability Identification
Using searchsploit, we quickly check for known vulnerabilities in the Argus Surveillance System. The search returns four possible vulnerabilities, and two of them immediately catch our attention:

Directory Traversal – This exploit could allow us to read arbitrary files on the server.
Weak Password Encryption – This vulnerability may expose poorly encrypted credentials, giving us a path to escalate privileges.

As these vulnerabilities are directly tied to our target application, we first decide to test the Directory Traversal exploit. After reviewing the code, we launch the attack and successfully retrieve files from the server’s filesystem. This confirms the server is vulnerable to Directory Traversal, allowing us to access sensitive files.

### Exploring the SSH Oddity
Next, we examine the Weak Password Encryption exploit. The documentation provides the path where password hashes are stored, and we attempt to retrieve it using Directory Traversal. However, we hit a roadblock—this method does not reveal the password data we expected.

At this point, we recall the unusual presence of the SSH service, which remains an intriguing anomaly for a Windows machine. Researching further, we discover that Argus Surveillance System stores SSH authentication files in the user’s home directory—specifically, the id_rsa private key used for secure logins.

Naturally, our first thought is to check for keys belonging to the Administrator user. However, upon accessing the home folder, we find no such keys for the default Administrator account.

Instead, after clicking around in the web interface, we notice a user named viewer. This user appears to have restricted access, but it's worth investigating further.

## Exploiting SSH Access
With the viewer user identified, we attempt to retrieve their SSH private key using the Directory Traversal vulnerability. Success! We manage to download the id_rsa file, which is the key needed to authenticate into the system.

Using this key, we successfully log in as the viewer user via SSH.

Unfortunately, the viewer user lacks administrative privileges, meaning we don't have complete control of the machine just yet.

### Privilege Escalation
Despite our restricted access, we haven’t forgotten the Weak Password Encryption vulnerability. Now that we have access to the system as viewer, we attempt to retrieve the password hash for the Administrator account.

We use the provided exploit script from Exploit-DB to decrypt the Administrator password hash. While the script is able to crack nearly all characters in the password, it struggles with one remaining special character.

The script manages to recover nearly every character of the password, except for one special character.

Rather than brute-forcing the entire password, we take a more efficient approach—manually testing different special characters. After just three attempts, we crack the password when we find that the missing character is a $ symbol.

With the Administrator password in hand, we log in as Administrator, gaining full control of the system.

## Credits

This lab underscores the importance of enumeration and a methodical approach to exploitation. While diving deep into specific vulnerabilities is valuable, sometimes unexpected services like SSH can lead to creative solutions. By focusing on discovery and vulnerability chaining (e.g., using Directory Traversal to retrieve SSH keys, then escalating privileges via Weak Password Encryption), we were able to gain full control of the target system.

Had we not thoroughly explored all services—particularly the odd presence of SSH on a Windows machine—we might have missed a critical path to exploitation. This reinforces the lesson that when something stands out, it’s worth investigating further.

Thanks for following along with this walkthrough, and we hope you learned a few new techniques to add to your pentesting toolkit!
